        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Strikeouts are one of the most defining statistics in modern baseball. They showcase a pitcher’s dominance, ability to miss bats, and overall effectiveness on the mound. But what if we could predict a pitcher’s strikeout percentage (K%) before the season even begins?</p>
        
        <p>Using <strong>historical MLB data from FanGraphs</strong>, I developed a <strong>machine learning model</strong> to estimate each pitcher’s <strong>K% for the 2024 season</strong>. The model analyzes past performance metrics, plate discipline data, and advanced pitching statistics to generate predictions.</p>

        <p>After testing multiple approaches, <strong>Ridge Regression</strong> proved to be the most accurate model for this task, outperforming other techniques such as <strong>Random Forest and XGBoost</strong>. Below, I’ll walk through my methodology, the key features that influence strikeout rates, and my final predictions for the <strong>2024 MLB season</strong>.</p>

        <h2>How Strikeouts Are Influenced by Pitching Metrics</h2>
        <p>Several factors contribute to a pitcher’s ability to generate swings and misses. Based on historical data and advanced sabermetrics, I identified the following key features as the best predictors of K%:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fastball Velocity (vFA)</strong> – Pitchers who throw harder generally generate more strikeouts.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact%</strong> – The percentage of times a batter makes contact when swinging; lower contact rates correlate with higher K%.</li>
            <li><strong>Zone Contact% (Z-Contact%)</strong> – The percentage of contact on pitches inside the strike zone.</li>
            <li><strong>Outside Contact% (O-Contact%)</strong> – The percentage of contact on pitches outside the strike zone.</li>
            <li><strong>Outside Swing% (O-Swing%)</strong> – How often batters swing at pitches outside the strike zone.</li>
            <li><strong>Earned Run Average (ERA)</strong> – While not directly related to strikeouts, a lower ERA often indicates better overall pitching quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Games Played (G)</strong> – Pitchers who appear in more games generally have more opportunities to record strikeouts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Building the Strikeout Prediction Model</h2>
        <p>After compiling the dataset, I tested four different machine learning models to determine which provided the most accurate predictions:</p>

        <h3>1. Linear Regression (Baseline Model)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>R²:</strong> 69.8%</li>
            <li><strong>RMSE:</strong> 0.02876</li>
            <li><strong>MAE:</strong> 0.02292</li>
            <li><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong> Provided a solid baseline but struggled with nonlinear relationships.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Random Forest (Nonlinear Approach)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>R²:</strong> 65.6%</li>
            <li><strong>RMSE:</strong> 0.03071</li>
            <li><strong>MAE:</strong> 0.02416</li>
            <li><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong> Captured nonlinear trends but had higher error rates than linear models.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. XGBoost (Gradient Boosting)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>R²:</strong> 67.3%</li>
            <li><strong>RMSE:</strong> 0.02989</li>
            <li><strong>MAE:</strong> 0.02366</li>
            <li><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong> Performed better than Random Forest but still fell short of the best model.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Ridge Regression (Best Model)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>R²:</strong> <strong>69.9%</strong></li>
            <li><strong>RMSE:</strong> <strong>0.02867</strong></li>
            <li><strong>MAE:</strong> <strong>0.02284</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong> Most accurate model for predicting K%. Effectively handled multicollinearity without overfitting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Final Predictions for the 2024 MLB Season</h2>
        <p>Using the final Ridge Regression model, I generated predictions for the 2024 season. The table below highlights five pitchers projected to have the highest K% in 2024:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Rank</th>
                <th>Pitcher</th>
                <th>Predicted K%</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td><strong>Spencer Strider</strong></td>
                <td><strong>34.5%</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>Jacob deGrom</td>
                <td>32.8%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>Shohei Ohtani</td>
                <td>30.7%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>4</td>
                <td>Corbin Burnes</td>
                <td>30.2%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>5</td>
                <td>Dylan Cease</td>
                <td>29.9%</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
