            <h2>üèÄ Predicting the NBA MVP with Machine Learning</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Every NBA season, the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award sparks intense debates among fans, analysts, and players. 
                What truly defines an MVP? Is it raw individual talent, team success, or a combination of various statistical measures? 
                The criteria are often subjective, but <strong>can we use data and machine learning to predict the next MVP?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project, I set out to answer that question by leveraging <strong>historical NBA data</strong> and 
                <strong>machine learning models</strong> to predict the <strong>2025 NBA MVP</strong>. Using a blend of 
                traditional statistics and advanced analytics, my goal was to identify patterns in previous MVP selections and apply 
                those insights to forecast the future winner.
            </p>

            <h3>Understanding the MVP Criteria</h3>
            <p>
                The MVP race is influenced by multiple factors beyond just scoring. <strong>Historical trends</strong> suggest that 
                MVP winners usually exhibit the following characteristics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Elite Performance</strong> ‚Äì High individual stats in scoring, efficiency, and advanced metrics.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Success</strong> ‚Äì MVPs are rarely from losing teams; top seeds dominate the award.</li>
                <li><strong>Narrative & Media Influence</strong> ‚Äì Voter perception matters, but it's difficult to quantify.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency</strong> ‚Äì The ability to perform at a high level throughout the season.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Using these principles, I gathered a comprehensive dataset of past MVP winners and key performance metrics to develop 
                a machine learning model that predicts the 2025 MVP race.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Collection & Feature Selection</h3>
            <p>
                To ensure an accurate model, I collected data from various sources, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Historical NBA MVP Data</strong> ‚Äì A dataset from Kaggle with past MVP winners and player performance stats.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced NBA Statistics</strong> ‚Äì Key efficiency metrics such as <strong>Win Shares per 48 minutes (WS/48)</strong> and <strong>Player Efficiency Rating (PER)</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Success Metrics</strong> ‚Äì Win-loss records and team seeding, as MVPs often come from the top-performing teams.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Through exploratory data analysis, I identified the most <strong>important features</strong> that influence MVP selection:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Value Over Replacement Player (VORP)</strong> ‚Äì A measure of a player's total contribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Win Shares per 48 Minutes (WS/48)</strong> ‚Äì Player impact on team wins per minute played.</li>
                <li><strong>Player Efficiency Rating (PER)</strong> ‚Äì A single number summarizing overall efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Points Per Game (PTS)</strong> ‚Äì A major factor in MVP candidacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Seeding (Seed)</strong> ‚Äì Higher-seeded teams have a stronger chance of producing an MVP.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Percentage (USG%)</strong> ‚Äì Indicates how much of a team's offense runs through the player.</li>
                <li><strong>Win-Loss Ratio</strong> ‚Äì Team success plays a significant role in voting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Model Development & Performance</h3>
            <p>
                To maximize prediction accuracy, I tested <strong>three different models</strong>:
            </p>

            <h4>üìä Linear Regression (Baseline Model)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>R¬≤:</strong> 51.2%</li>
                <li><strong>LOYOCV Accuracy:</strong> 61.9%</li>
                <li><strong>Key Findings:</strong> While effective at identifying general trends, it struggled with complex interactions between variables.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>üå≤ Random Forest (Improved Model)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>R¬≤:</strong> 66.8%</li>
                <li><strong>LOYOCV Accuracy:</strong> 71.4%</li>
                <li><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Performed significantly better, capturing nonlinear relationships and ranking feature importance effectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>üöÄ XGBoost (Best Model)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>R¬≤:</strong> 67.3%</li>
                <li><strong>LOYOCV Accuracy:</strong> <strong>83.3%</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Key Findings:</strong> The most accurate model, outperforming both Linear Regression and Random Forest.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Predicting the 2025 NBA MVP</h3>
            <p>
                After training the final <strong>XGBoost model</strong>, I applied it to the 2025 season data to generate predicted MVP vote shares for the top contenders. The model‚Äôs prediction for the <strong>2025 NBA MVP</strong> is:
            </p>

            <h2>üèÜ Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</h2>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Rank</th>
                    <th>Player</th>
                    <th>Predicted MVP Share</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1</td>
                    <td><strong>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>0.8774</strong></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2</td>
                    <td>Nikola Jokiƒá</td>
                    <td>0.6805</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>Karl-Anthony Towns</td>
                    <td>0.2352</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>Evan Mobley</td>
                    <td>0.2315</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>5</td>
                    <td>Giannis Antetokounmpo</td>
                    <td>0.2182</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                With an <strong>83.3% accuracy rate</strong>, this model successfully identified past MVPs and projects 
                <strong>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander</strong> as the 2025 winner. As the season unfolds, it will be exciting to see how well the predictions hold up.
